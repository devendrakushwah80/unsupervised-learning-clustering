# Unsupervised Learning – Clustering Analysis

This repository contains a hands-on implementation of **clustering techniques** using Python and machine learning libraries. The notebook focuses on grouping unlabeled data points based on similarity and visualizing the resulting clusters.

## 📌 Project Overview

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique used to discover hidden patterns or groupings in data without predefined labels.  
In this project, different clustering approaches are applied, analyzed, and visualized to understand how data naturally forms clusters.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Unsupervised Learning  
- Clustering Fundamentals  
- Distance-based similarity  
- Cluster visualization  
- Model evaluation and interpretation  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
